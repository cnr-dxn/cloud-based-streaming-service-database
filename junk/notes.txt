objective: be able to punch in a title and have it return all streaming services (or none) the title is on
brain dump:
 - link to sql/mongoDB with title, rating (either IMDB or RT), year it came out, and streaming services its located on (4)
 - one giant scanning funciton, which scans each streaming service and puts it into it's own database (thinking mongo...)
 - runs off raspberry pi, updating every morning, must upload to a database in the cloud
 - much later, link to website so i can do it anywhere
 - doing in python, gotta be easier, and good practice with python
issues:
 - how to link database to program
 - how to connect all to website (might need to do first)
 - make sure website in question can be accessed and scraped by beautifulsoup
 - how to identify which elements are which from website
reasons not to just donwload app:
 - practice
 - more reliable
 - UI practice (maybe)
 - practice

3 tables
 - movies/tvs
 - junction
 - streaming services
to insert
 - replace (insert if not already existing) into table should it be absent
 - insert instance (movie key, streaming key, time stamp)
   - time stamp so we dont have to remove titles out of the library
     - one sub query? two sub queries? something like that
to insert exactly
 - select if exists (either using hashing the whole row or index i guess)
 - if so, dont insert
 - if yes, insert
to insert junction
 - use epoch time

 - deleted first two lines, 
 - got rid of all not nulls

CREATE TABLE tasks (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    start_date DATE NOT NULL,
    end_date DATE
);
